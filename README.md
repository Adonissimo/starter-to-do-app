# starter-to-do-app
Exercise 3 - Collaborative Mini-Project with Code Standards and Git Workflow

. Objective
Students will practice:
•	Applying coding standards and style guidelines.
•	Using an IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse) with relevant extensions (linters, formatters, Git plugins).
•	Managing code with a Version Control System (Git + GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
•	Collaborating effectively with peers using branching, pull requests, and code reviews.

II. Instructions
Setup Phase
1.	Form small groups (2–4 members).
2.	Clone the starter repository (contains the faulty To-Do List App code in both Python and Java).
3.	Each group will work on fixing either the Python version or the Java version.
4.	Create a Git repository hosted online (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

III. IDE & Extensions
•	Install and configure IDE with extensions for:
o	Linting/formatting (e.g., Pylint/Black for Python, Checkstyle/SonarLint for Java).
o	Git integration.
o	Code documentation helpers (e.g., Docstring Generator, JavaDoc tools).
•	Set up coding style rules (PEP8 for Python, Google Java Style Guide for Java, or project-specific rules).

IV. Activity (Task to Do)
(Please refer to faulty codes attached in the canvas)

A. Coding Phase
•	Each member works on a feature branch (e.g., fix-input, feature-validation, feature-ui).
•	Write code following agreed-upon standards (naming conventions, indentation, comments).

B. Version Control & Collaboration
•	Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages.
•	Push changes to the remote repository.
•	Open Pull Requests (PRs) or Merge Requests (MRs) for each fix/feature.
•	Conduct peer code reviews: check for coding standards, clarity, and functionality.

C. Integration Phase
•	Merge branches into main only after approval.
•	Resolve any merge conflicts collaboratively.

D. Submission
•	Final repository should include:
o	Corrected Python or Java To-Do List App.
o	README.md with project overview and setup instructions.
o	Git history showing collaboration.


E. Deliverables (FileName: LastName_Exercise3.pdf)
•	GitHub/GitLab repo link (to be paste here)
•	Short reflection report (per student)

Reflection Questions
As you work on fixing the To-Do List App (Python/Java), answer the following questions. Be specific — point out the exact code lines/issues and explain how you fixed them.

1. Coding Standard Issues
•	Which parts of the code violate standard naming conventions (e.g., function/method names, variable names)?
•	Were there inconsistent indentations, spacing, or braces/colons?
•	Did you add comments or docstrings/JavaDocs to improve readability?
•	Which IDE extensions or linters flagged these issues?

2. Logic Errors
•	Did you find off-by-one errors (e.g., task numbering vs. array/list index)? Where?
•	Were there loops or conditions that caused crashes (like going out of bounds)?
•	How did the program behave when users entered invalid inputs?
•	How did you fix these logic errors? (e.g., index checks, exception handling).

3. User Experience (UX) Issues
•	Were the messages to users consistent and clear? Give examples of confusing outputs.
•	Did the program crash when users typed the wrong input type (like a string instead of a number)?
•	Did you make the program more user-friendly (e.g., confirmation before deleting, better menu display)?
•	How could the app be made more robust and interactive?

4. Structural Issues
•	Is all logic written in a single class/file? Could it be reorganized for clarity?
•	Are there global variables (Python) or overuse of static (Java)? How could this be improved?
•	Did you consider using object-oriented design (e.g., a Task class)?
•	Did you improve separation of concerns (UI, logic, data handling)?

5. Collaboration & Tools
•	How did your group divide the work (branches/features)?
•	Did you face any merge conflicts? How were they resolved?
•	Which Git practices (commits, pull requests, code reviews) helped your collaboration?
•	Which IDE plugins/extensions were most useful in spotting/fixing issues?
